<h2>Rules</h2>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
Anyone can participate in angstromCTF, however, due to various reasons, we can only give prizes to teams from the United States.
Sending money from the US to other countries is a terrible pain and is mired in all sorts of legal issues.
All team members must be affiliated with either a public or private middle or high school in the US, or they may be home-schooled. Students and adults from around the world can still participate, however, they will be unable to win any prizes.

<h4>Rules and Restrictions</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>You may use any tool</strong>, subject to the restrictions below, at your disposal to attempt to solve the problems. We especially encourage the use of free and open-source tools. The Prime Directive of CTFs is <i>Google Is Your Friend</i>.
    <li>We're fine with you asking non-team members (or posting on sites like StackOverflow) for technical assistance with pre-existing software while solving problems. For example, getting help from a teacher installing Python on your computer is allowed.  However, <strong>only team members may make substantial contributions to solving a problem</strong>.  You can't just reword a problem and post it on an online forum to get help.</li>
    <li>Each member of the team must have an account and have a valid email. Each member may only have one account.</li>
    <li><strong>Each team is limited to five members. No exceptions.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No flag or hint sharing</strong>.  Don't accept hints from anyone except potentially angstromCTF staff.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not attempt to attack or interfere with other teams or any servers used in this competition that are not explicitly designated for being hacked in a problem</strong>. Doing so will get you IP banned and disqualified from the competition. We will notify your school as well.</li>
    <li><strong>No brute-force guessing flags.</strong> Feel free to try several flags if you're not sure, but don't try any sort of brute forcing on the flags.  We're tracking all of your submissions.</li>
    <li>Finally, have fun and try and learn something new!</li>
</ol>

<h4>Scoring</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Each problem has a point value listed. The team who earns the most points wins the competition. If two teams tie, the submission times will be used to judge.</li>
    <li>The prize winning teams will be contacted by us after the contest ends. More information will be included in the email.</li>
    <li>In the event that a team that is ineligible for prizes wins a prize, the next eligible, high school or middle school US team will recieve that prize.</li>
</ol>

Anyone who violates these rules will be disqualified. <strong>All decisions made by angstromCTF are final.</strong>

<h2>Team</h2>

AngstromCTF is created by several students, all at MBHS. In no particular order, they are:

<div class="row about-row">
    {% for person in people %}
        <div class="about-block col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
            <img class="circular about-img" align="middle" src="{{ person.picture }}">

            <div class="about-caption">
                {{ person.name }}, {{ person.grade|grade_to_name }}
                <br/>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">{{ person.contributions }}</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
