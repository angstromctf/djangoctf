<p>Welcome to angstromCTF, a new capture-the-flag (CTF) competition hosted by high school students!
CTF cybersecurity competitions have become an increasingly popular form of challenges for aspiring cybersecurity students.
After the success of high-school CTF games like picoCTF, we decided to run our own CTF competition called angstromCTF.
angstromCTF will consist of questions ranging from trivial to extremely difficult in various categories:

<ul>
	<li>Binary exploitation</li>
	<li>Reverse engineering</li>
	<li>Cryptography</li>
	<li>Web exploitation</li>
	<li>Forensics</li>
	<li>Hardware</li>
	<li>Combination</li>
</ul>
