Welcome to angstromCTF, a new capture-the-flag (CTF) competition hosted by high school students!
CTF cybersecurity competitions have become an increasingly popular form of challenges for aspiring cybersecurity students.
These competitions are designed to <strong>educate and inspire high school students through interactive hacking
challenges.</strong> After the success of high-school CTF games (especially <a href="https://picoctf.com/" target="_blank">picoCTF</a>),
we decided to run our own CTF competition
called angstromCTF. angstromCTF will consist of questions ranging from trivial to extremely difficult in
various categories:<br/><br/>

        <div class="category-icon" style="background-color: lightgrey;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></span></div>
        <h4 class="category">Cryptography</h4>

        Crack codes and ciphers, ranging from the simple (Caesar cipher, Vigen&egrave;re cipher) to the complex
        (RSA, elliptic curves).  Do cryptanalysis, use deduction, and get the flags!
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4">
        <div class="category-icon" style="background-color: lightblue;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></span></div>
        <h4 class="category">Binary Exploitation</h4>

        Apply a range of skills to exploit security vulnerabilities in programs, including buffer overflows,
        arithmetic overflows, format string bugs, and use-after-frees.
        Force these binaries to run your own code and read the flag!
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4">
        <div class="category-icon" style="background-color: lightgreen;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe" aria-hidden="true"></span></div>
        <h4 class="category">Web Exploitation</h4>

        Find various vulnerabilities in web pages, and use them to get access to areas you shouldn't.
        This topic covers a wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and mistakes in using
        scripting languages. Use your new-found access to recover the flag!

    <div class="col-lg-4">
        <div class="category-icon" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog" aria-hidden="true"></span></div>
        <h4 class="category">Reverse Engineering</h4>

        Examine programs given to you and find out their code, from simple Java apps to more difficult ELF binaries.
        Figure out their inner workings and use the information you gather to find the flag!
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4">
        <div class="category-icon" style="background-color: lightslategray;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span></div>
        <h4 class="category">Forensics</h4>

        Explore the art of digital forensics, which is all about uncovering hidden data within a
        large swath of information. Solve challenging puzzles in areas such as stenography,
        memory forensics, data recovery, and system examination. You can find the flag if you look carefully enough!

        <h3 class="category">Master Challenges</h3>
        Get a taste of cybersecurity in the real world as you struggle through these master challenges and
        combine your knowledge of all the previous topics!
