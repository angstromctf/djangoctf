Welcome to angstromCTF, a new capture-the-flag (CTF) competition hosted by high school students!
CTF cybersecurity competitions have become an increasingly popular form of challenges for aspiring cybersecurity students.
These competitions are designed to <strong>educate and inspire high school students through interactive hacking
challenges.</strong> After the success of high-school CTF games (especially <a href="https://picoctf.com/" target="_blank">picoCTF</a>),
we decided to run our own CTF competition
called angstromCTF. angstromCTF will consist of questions ranging from trivial to extremely difficult in
various categories:<br/><br/>

<ul>
	<li>Binary exploitation</li>
	<li>Reverse engineering</li>
	<li>Cryptography</li>
	<li>Web exploitation</li>
	<li>Forensics</li>
	<li>Hardware</li>
	<li>Combination</li>
</ul>

angstromCTF will be similar to many high other school CTFs that we've participated in: <br/><br/>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://picoctf.com/" target="_blank">picoCTF</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://sctf.io" target="_blank">sCTF</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://hsctf.com/" target="_blank">HSCTF</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://camsctf.com/" target="_blank">CAMSCTF</a></li>
    <li>TJCTF</li>
</ul>

However, unlike many other
high school CTF competitions, angstromCTF will focus less on forensics and have no reconnaisance problems (i.e.
problems where you need to hunt down hidden information across the internet).  It will instead focus more on
cryptography and binary exploitation, areas we feel have been underrepresented in other high-school CTFs.
