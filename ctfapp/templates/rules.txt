Eligibility:
Anyone can participate in angstromCTF, however due to various reasons we can only give prizes to teams from the USA.
The majority of the team must be affiliated with either a public or private middle or high school. Students and adults from around the world can still participate, however they will be unable to win any prizes.

Rules and Restrictions:
You may use any tool at your disposal to attempt to solve the problems. Only the members of the teams themselves can solve the challenges.
You can look up information regarding certain parts of problems, such as the specifications for an ELF or how to check if a number is prime. However, you cannot reword/copy-paste the problem into Google or StackOverflow. 
Each member of the team **must** have an account and have a valid email. Each member can only have ONE account.
Each team is limited to X members. 
Please don't flag share! It's bad for everyone! :(
Do not attempt to attack or interfere with other teams or any servers used in this competition. Doing so will get you IP banned and disqualified from the competition. We will notify your school as well. 
Finally, have fun and try and learn something new!

Scoring:
Each problem has a point value listed. The team who earns the most points wins the competition. If two teams tie, the submission times will be used to judge. 
The prize winning teams will be contacted by us after the contest ends. More information will be included in the email. 
In the event that a team that is ineligible for prizes wins a prize, the next US team will recieve that prize.


Anyone who violates these rules will be disqualified. All decisions made by us are final.
