    <p>Welcome to angstromCTF, a capture-the-flag (CTF) competition hosted and written by entirely by students at Montgomery Blair High School!
    CTF cybersecurity competitions have become an increasingly popular way for students to learn more about cybersecurity
    and develop and refine their hacking skills.
    These competitions are designed to <strong>educate and inspire high school students through interactive hacking
    challenges.</strong></p>

    <p>The first angstromCTF took place April 8-17, 2016. It was a phenomenal success, with almost 500 teams participating and submitting thousands of problem solutions.
    This year, we're following up with exciting new problems and prizes. One of our chief goals this year to make our competition
    <strong>as accessible as possible</strong> to students with <strong>little to no background knowledge in hacking
    and cybersecurity</strong>. If you're looking for where to start, check out our <a href="{% url 'learn:index' %}">learning materials</a>.</p>

    <br/><br/>
    {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

    <p>Students will compete in <strong>teams of up to five members</strong>. Points are given for answering each question
    (entering the flag). Prizes will be awarded to the top-scoring US high-school teams. {{ ctf_name }} is meant for
    <strong>both beginners and experienced CTFers</strong> and consists of questions ranging from simple to extremely
    difficult in various categories. If you have any questions, join our IRC <a href="{% url 'chat' %}" target="_blank">here</a> or #angstromctf on freenode.</p><br/>

            <h4 class="category">Cryptography</h4>

            Crack codes and ciphers, ranging from the simple (Caesar cipher, Vigen&egrave;re cipher) to the complex
            (RSA, elliptic curves). Do cryptanalysis, use deduction, and get the flags!

            <h4 class="category">Binary Exploitation</h4>

            Apply a range of skills to exploit security vulnerabilities in programs, including buffer overflows,
            arithmetic overflows, format string bugs, and use-after-frees.
            Force these binaries to run your own code and read the flag!

            <h4 class="category">Web Exploitation</h4>

            Find various vulnerabilities in web pages, and use them to get access to areas you shouldn't.
            This topic covers a wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and mistakes in using
            scripting languages. Use your new-found access to recover the flag!

            <h4 class="category">Reverse Engineering</h4>

            Examine programs given to you and find out their code, from simple Java apps to more difficult ELF binaries.
            Figure out their inner workings and use the information you gather to find the flag!

            <h4 class="category">Forensics</h4>

            Explore the art of digital forensics, which is all about uncovering hidden data within a
            large swath of information. Solve challenging puzzles in areas such as stenography,
            memory forensics, data recovery, and system examination. You can find the flag if you look carefully enough!
