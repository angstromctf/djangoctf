# djangoctf v1.0
A platform for jeopardy CTF (capture-the-flag) competitions written in Django.

CTF cybersecurity competitions have become an increasingly popular form of challenges for aspiring cybersecurity students.
After the success of high-school CTF games like picoCTF, we, the members of Montgomery Blair High School's Cybersecurity Club, decided to run our own CTF competition called [angstromCTF](https://angstromctf.com).
angstromCTF consists of questions ranging from trivial to extremely difficult in various categories:

* Binary exploitation
* Reverse engineering
* Cryptography
* Web exploitation
* Forensics
* Master challenges

Using this platform, participants will login, read and answer challenges, and receive updates.  Teams can be created and joined by participants.  The platform is designed to be extensible and re-usable for other CTFs and competitions.

This platform is actively maintained by Noah Singer (singerng@gmail.com), as well as other members of the project, including Artemis Tosini (me@artem.ist) and Chris Wang (kisa.ayano@icloud.com).
