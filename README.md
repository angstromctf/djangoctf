# djangoctf
A basic platform for jeopardy CTF (capture-the-flag) competitions written in Django.

CTF cybersecurity competitions have become an increasingly popular form of challenges for aspiring cybersecurity students.
After the success of high-school CTF games like picoCTF, we decided to run our own CTF competition called angstromCTF.
angstromCTF will consist of questions ranging from trivial to extremely difficult in various categories:

* Binary exploitation
* Reverse engineering
* Cryptography
* Web exploitation
* Combination

This repository contains Django code for the public web interface of angstromCTF.
Participants will login, read and answer questions, receive updates, and ask for help through this platform.
